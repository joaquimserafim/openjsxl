A fast, **zero-dependency**, TypeScript-first Excel (`.xlsx`) library for JavaScript
runtimes — Node, Deno, Bun, the browser, and edge.

> Status: **reader + writer — pre-1.0.** Read typed cells, styles, number formats, formulas,
> merged ranges, hyperlinks, comments, and pictures; stream large sheets in roughly constant
> memory; get typed errors on malformed input. Write `.xlsx` from plain data with `writeXlsx`,
> and read → modify → write with `workbookToInput`. **New in 0.6:** anchored pictures — read
> them with `sheet.images()`, write them via `images` on a sheet, and they round-trip through
> the bridge byte-exact (png, jpeg, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, emf, wmf). **New in 0.7:** it now
> *reads* more than it writes — `.xlsb`, `.ods`, and `.csv`/`.tsv` open into the same `Workbook`,
> with `detectSpreadsheetFormat` to route by content. **New in 0.8:** the opt-in `openjsxl/formula`
> entry *evaluates* formulas — `evaluateWorkbook`/`evaluateCell` over 90+ built-ins, plus your own.
> **New in 0.9:** three structural features that read AND write — defined **tables**, **data
> validation** (dropdowns and input rules), and **conditional formatting** (highlights, colour scales,
> data bars, icon sets) — plus hardening: string content survives XML-illegal characters via
> ST_Xstring escaping, and every read is guarded against decompression bombs by default (a 2 GiB
> per-part ceiling + a 300× compression-ratio cap, both tunable).
> Published on npm. Built in the open, plan-first — see the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) and
> [implementation plan](./IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Quick start

`.xlsx` → JSON, in well under 50 lines:

```ts
import { openXlsx } from 'openjsxl';
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

// Open a workbook from bytes (Uint8Array or ArrayBuffer).
const wb = await openXlsx(await readFile('data.xlsx'));

// Read one cell — it's typed, so `cell.type` narrows `cell.value`.
const a1 = wb.sheet('Sheet1').cell('A1');
console.log(a1.type, a1.value); // e.g. "string" "hello"

// Or turn a whole sheet into JSON records keyed by column letter.
const sheet = wb.sheet(wb.sheets[0].name);
const rows = [];
for await (const row of sheet.rows()) {
	const record = {};
	for (const cell of row.cells) {
		record[cell.ref.replace(/\d+$/, '')] = cell.value;
	}
	rows.push(record);
}
console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2));
```

Cells are a discriminated union — `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `error`, or
`empty` — so narrowing on `cell.type` gives you a correctly typed `cell.value`.

### Large files

`openXlsx` decompresses each sheet so `cell('A1')` is random-access and synchronous. For
sheets too big to hold in memory, `streamSheetRows` reads row-at-a-time with roughly constant
memory — the worksheet is never materialized whole:

```ts
import { streamSheetRows } from 'openjsxl';
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const bytes = await readFile('huge.xlsx');
for await (const row of streamSheetRows(bytes /*, 'Sheet1' */)) {
	// one row at a time; previous rows are already freed
	process.stdout.write(`${row.index}: ${row.cells.length} cells\n`);
}
```

### Styles, metadata & typed errors

Beyond values, a worksheet exposes each cell's resolved style and the metadata Excel writers
attach — number formats, merged ranges, hyperlinks, comments, sheet geometry, and the declared
used range. Number formats resolve through the cell's own style, then the column (`<col>`) and
row defaults, so a date column reads as dates even when its cells carry no style of their own.
Malformed input throws a typed `XlsxError` with a discriminating `code`, never a bare
`TypeError` from a corrupt file.

```ts
import { openXlsx, XlsxError } from 'openjsxl';
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

let wb;
try {
	// Zip-bomb guards are ON by default (a 2 GiB per-part ceiling + a 300× compression-ratio
	// cap); tighten or disable them per read — here, a stricter 50 MB ceiling.
	wb = await openXlsx(await readFile('report.xlsx'), { maxPartBytes: 50_000_000 });
} catch (err) {
	if (err instanceof XlsxError) {
		// code: 'not-a-zip' | 'not-xlsx' | 'missing-part' | 'corrupt-zip' | 'part-too-large' | …
		console.error(`could not read xlsx (${err.code}): ${err.message}`);
		process.exit(1);
	}
	throw err;
}

const sheet = wb.sheet(wb.sheets[0].name);

sheet.style('B2'); // { font?, fill?, border?, alignment?, numberFormat? } | undefined
sheet.numberFormat('C1'); // "mm-dd-yy" — the format code, independent of the value
sheet.formula('E1'); // "B1*2" — the formula text (shared formulas come back translated)
sheet.dimension; // "A1:E2" | undefined (the declared used range)
sheet.mergedCells; // ["A1:B1", "A2:A4", …]
sheet.hyperlinks; // [{ ref: "A1", target: "https://…", tooltip?, location?, display? }, …]
sheet.comments; // [{ ref: "A1", author: "Ada", text: "note" }, …]
sheet.columns; // [{ min: 2, max: 3, width: 25.5, hidden? }, …] — column geometry
sheet.rowProperties; // Map<row, { height?, hidden? }>
sheet.freeze; // { rows?, cols? } | undefined — the frozen pane
sheet.state; // "visible" | "hidden" | "veryHidden" (sheet.visible is the boolean)

await sheet.images(); // [{ anchor, bytes, mime, name? }, …] — anchored pictures; `bytes` is the
// raw image payload, `anchor` the raw cell + EMU geometry. Async & lazy: media is only
// decompressed on first call (once per drawing part — sheets sharing a logo each read it once)

wb.resolveColor({ theme: 4, tint: 0.4 }); // "FF96B4D8" — a style color as 8-digit ARGB,
// resolved against the workbook's own theme (colors stay raw {theme, tint} in the style model)
```

## Writing

Describe a workbook as plain data and `writeXlsx` returns the `.xlsx` bytes. The cell type is
inferred from each JavaScript value — `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `Date` (written as a
date-formatted serial), and `null`/`undefined` for an empty cell:

```ts
import { writeXlsx } from 'openjsxl';
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const bytes = await writeXlsx({
	sheets: [
		{
			name: 'Report',
			rows: [
				['Item', 'Qty', 'Price', 'Added'],
				['Apples', 120, 0.5, new Date('2024-01-15')],
				['Pears', 80, 0.75, null],
			],
		},
	],
});

await writeFile('report.xlsx', bytes); // opens cleanly in Excel and LibreOffice
```

The output is deterministic (identical input → identical bytes), strings are written inline (no
shared-strings table), and input the format can't represent — no sheets, a bad or duplicate sheet
name, a non-finite number, an invalid `Date` — throws a typed `XlsxError` with
`code: 'invalid-input'` rather than producing a file Excel must repair. String *content* never
throws: characters XML can't carry (control chars, lone surrogates) are stored with the same
`_xHHHH_` escape Excel uses, so they round-trip instead of corrupting or rejecting.
An optional second argument `writeXlsx(input, { date1904: true })` selects the 1904 date epoch
(legacy Mac workbooks); dates are 1900-epoch by default.

### Styles & layout (0.4)

A cell can also be `{ value, style }` — the style shape is exactly what `sheet.style(ref)`
returns, so styles pass straight through a round trip. Sheets take column widths, row heights,
frozen panes, merged ranges, hyperlinks, and a visibility state:

```ts
const bold = { font: { bold: true }, fill: { patternType: 'solid', fgColor: { rgb: 'FFDDEBF7' } } };

const bytes = await writeXlsx({
	sheets: [
		{
			name: 'Report',
			rows: [
				[
					{ value: 'Item', style: bold },
					{ value: 'Total', style: bold },
				],
				['Apples', { value: 1234.5, style: { numberFormat: '#,##0.00' } }],
			],
			columns: [{ min: 1, max: 1, width: 18 }], // widen column A
			freeze: { rows: 1 }, // keep the header visible
			merges: ['A3:B3'],
			hyperlinks: [{ ref: 'A2', target: 'https://example.com/apples', tooltip: 'docs' }],
		},
		{ name: 'Internal', rows: [['scratch']], state: 'hidden' },
	],
});
```

### Comments, formulas & streaming (0.5)

A cell can carry a formula (`{ formula, value? }` — the cached `value` is what non-recalculating
readers see), sheets take `comments` (written with the legacy VML part Excel needs to actually
*show* them on hover), and `streamXlsx` is the constant-memory mirror of `writeXlsx` — each
sheet's `rows` may be any sync or async iterable (a DB cursor, a paged API), pulled only as the
output stream drains, so the full sheet never lives in memory:

```ts
import { streamXlsx, writeXlsx } from 'openjsxl';

const bytes = await writeXlsx({
	sheets: [
		{
			name: 'Report',
			rows: [[42, { formula: 'A1*2', value: 84 }]],
			comments: [{ ref: 'A1', author: 'Ada', text: 'the answer' }],
		},
	],
});

// Same input shape, but rows can be lazy — memory stays flat at any row count.
const stream = streamXlsx({ sheets: [{ name: 'Big', rows: millionRowCursor() }] });
await stream.pipeTo(destination);
```

The streaming writer's flat memory is **constant in rows** — row data is pulled and released as
the output drains. Pictures are the exception: image bytes (passed by reference, never copied)
are held until the media parts flush at the end of the stream.

### Pictures (0.6)

Sheets take `images` — the same `{ anchor, bytes, mime, name? }` records `sheet.images()`
returns, so pictures pass straight through a round trip. The anchor is raw OOXML geometry: a
1-based `from` cell plus sizes in EMU (≈ 9 525 EMU per pixel at 96 dpi). Pin a fixed-size logo
with `ext`, or span cells with `to`:

```ts
const bytes = await writeXlsx({
	sheets: [
		{
			name: 'Report',
			rows: [['Q3 Sales']],
			images: [
				{
					anchor: { from: { col: 4, row: 1 }, ext: { cx: 96 * 9525, cy: 96 * 9525 } },
					bytes: logoBytes, // Uint8Array — written verbatim, never decoded
					mime: 'image/png', // png, jpeg, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, emf, wmf
					name: 'Logo',
				},
			],
		},
	],
});
```

Identical image bytes are deduplicated into one media part workbook-wide, and a workbook
without images emits no drawing machinery at all.

### Read → modify → write

`workbookToInput` turns an open `Workbook` back into writer input, so you can round-trip a file:

```ts
import { openXlsx, workbookToInput, writeXlsx } from 'openjsxl';
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const wb = await openXlsx(await readFile('in.xlsx'));
const input = await workbookToInput(wb);
const sheets = input.sheets.map((sheet, i) =>
	i === 0 ? { ...sheet, rows: [...sheet.rows, ['appended', 'row']] } : sheet,
); // tweak the plain data (the input is deeply readonly — spread, don't mutate)
await writeFile('out.xlsx', await writeXlsx({ ...input, sheets }));
```

The round trip is **lossless for values, types, sheet names/order, styles, formulas, comments,
pictures, geometry, structural metadata, defined names, tables, data validation, conditional
formatting, autofilters, protection, and print setup**:

| Round-trips losslessly | Not carried (yet) |
| --- | --- |
| string, number, boolean, `Date` values | error cells without a formula (written as their text) |
| number formats — built-in & custom codes | absolute-anchored pictures & non-picture drawings (shapes, charts) — skipped on read |
| fonts, fills, borders, alignment | picture effects (crop, rotation, borders) — a picture carries anchor + bytes + type + name |
| colors: rgb, indexed, theme + tint (raw) | in-cell rich-text runs — flattened to plain text (values survive; per-run bold/color is lost) |
| control chars & `_xHHHH_` literals in strings (ST_Xstring escape) | autofilter **criteria** & sort state — the filter range carries, the per-column filter/sort is dropped |
| | printer-settings binary (`printerSettings.bin`) & manual page breaks — dropped |
| custom theme part (carried byte-identical) | |
| formula text + cached value | |
| defined names / named ranges (global & sheet-scoped, incl. `_xlnm.*` built-ins) | |
| comments (author + text, Excel-visible) | |
| anchored pictures (bytes byte-exact, anchor, type, name) | |
| empty cells (sparse), incl. styled blanks | |
| column widths, row heights, hidden, freeze | |
| merged ranges & hyperlinks | |
| sheet visibility (hidden / veryHidden) | |
| sheet names & tab order | |
| tables (name, range, columns, header/totals, style) | |
| data validations (dropdowns & input rules) | |
| conditional formatting (highlights, scales, bars, icon sets) | |
| autofilter range (filter dropdowns; the paired `_xlnm._FilterDatabase` is managed automatically) | |
| protection — sheet & workbook locks, per-cell locked/hidden, password hashes carried verbatim | |
| print setup — margins, orientation, scale, fit-to-page, paper size, print options, header/footer | |

Documented flattenings (values stay exact; internal spelling normalizes): row/column *default*
styles resolve into per-cell styles (each cell keeps its effective format); shared and array
formulas re-emit as per-cell plain formulas (the same text Excel shows in each cell — data-table
formulas keep only their cached value); a tolerated non-canonical cell ref spelling (e.g.
lowercase `a1`) re-emits canonically (`A1`); a foreign producer's out-of-spec table name (a space,
a cell-reference shape, empty) normalizes into a legal identifier so the table re-saves rather than
aborting; and media parts renumber with alternate extension spellings normalized (`tif` → `tiff`,
`jpg` → `jpeg` — the image bytes themselves are untouched).

## Reading other formats (0.7)

openjsxl **writes `.xlsx`**, but it **reads more**: `openXlsb` (Excel Binary Workbook), `openOds`
(OpenDocument / LibreOffice), and `openCsv` (delimited text) all return the SAME `Workbook` as
`openXlsx` — typed cells, the same accessors, the same discriminated-union `Cell`.
`detectSpreadsheetFormat(bytes)` sniffs the container so "a user uploaded a spreadsheet" is one
code path, and any reader becomes a converter to `.xlsx` through the bridge:

```ts
import {
	detectSpreadsheetFormat, openXlsx, openXlsb, openOds, openCsv,
	workbookToInput, writeXlsx,
} from 'openjsxl';
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

const bytes = await readFile('upload.bin');
const wb = await (async () => {
	switch (await detectSpreadsheetFormat(bytes)) {
		case 'xlsx': return openXlsx(bytes); // also .xlsm / .xltx / .xltm
		case 'xlsb': return openXlsb(bytes);
		case 'ods':  return openOds(bytes);
		case 'csv':  return openCsv(bytes);  // synchronous — CSV has no container
		default: throw new Error('unrecognized spreadsheet format');
	}
})();

await writeFile('out.xlsx', await writeXlsx(await workbookToInput(wb))); // convert to .xlsx
```

Each reader returns the shared model; features a format can't express **degrade** (`style()` →
`undefined`, `mergedCells` → `[]`, `images()` → `[]`), never throw. What each format carries:

| Format | Reads | Not carried (degrades) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`.xlsx` / `.xlsm` / `.xltx`** | everything in the round-trip table above | — |
| **`.xlsb`** | values & types, dates (style-driven), number formats, hyperlinks, dimension, sheet visibility | merges, formula text (cached values kept), styles, comments, geometry, images |
| **`.ods`** | values & types, dates, merges, in-cell hyperlinks, sheet names/order | styles & number formats, formula text (cached values kept), visibility, comments, geometry, images |
| **`.csv` / `.tsv`** | values with conservative type inference (numbers & booleans; **never dates**), one sheet, auto-detected delimiter | everything structural — CSV carries none |

`detectSpreadsheetFormat` returns `'xlsx' | 'xlsb' | 'ods' | 'csv' | undefined`. Container formats
are identified by their package; **CSV has no magic bytes**, so any non-zip input that decodes as
UTF-8 text classifies as `'csv'` — a documented best-effort heuristic, not a guarantee. Encrypted
`.ods` and other unreadable inputs fail with a typed `XlsxError`.

## Formulas (0.8)

The reader keeps a formula's **text** and its cached value; the opt-in `openjsxl/formula` entry adds
a zero-dependency **engine** that recomputes them. It's a separate import so a consumer who never
touches formulas never loads a byte of the parser or evaluator, and the core `openjsxl` bundle is
byte-for-byte unchanged whether or not it exists.

```ts
import { openXlsx } from 'openjsxl';
import { evaluateWorkbook, evaluateCell, parseFormula } from 'openjsxl/formula';

const wb = await openXlsx(bytes);
const result = await evaluateWorkbook(wb);   // every formula cell, recomputed
result.get('Sheet1', 'B2');                  // e.g. 84  (a number | string | boolean | error value)

await evaluateCell(wb, 'Sheet1', 'B2');      // or just one cell (+ its dependencies)
parseFormula('SUM(A1:A9)*2');                // …or just the typed AST, no evaluation
```

Evaluation is **read-only** — the workbook and its stored `<v>` caches are never mutated, so a
recomputed value can (correctly) supersede a stale cache. Deep dependency chains don't grow the JS
stack, and **circular references resolve to a dedicated `#CYCLE!` value** rather than hanging — the
cycle's cells become `#CYCLE!` while every unrelated cell still evaluates.

**Bring your own functions.** `options.functions` registers user-defined functions with the same
shape the 90+ built-ins use (case-insensitive, eager or lazy):

```ts
await evaluateWorkbook(wb, {
  functions: { MILESTOKM: { minArgs: 1, maxArgs: 1, evaluate: ([mi]) => Number(mi) * 1.60934 } },
});
```

**Determinism is enforced.** Volatile functions have no ambient source: `TODAY`/`NOW` and
`RAND`/`RANDBETWEEN` throw a typed `FormulaError` unless you inject `options.now` / `options.random`,
so the same inputs always produce the same output.

**Built-in coverage (90+).** Math/stats (`SUM` `AVERAGE` `COUNT*` `MIN` `MAX` `MEDIAN` `LARGE`
`SMALL` `ROUND*` `INT` `ABS` `MOD` `POWER` `SQRT` `EXP` `LN` `LOG*` `SIGN` `TRUNC` `CEILING` `FLOOR`
`SUMPRODUCT`), logical (`IF` `IFERROR` `IFNA` `IFS` `SWITCH` `AND` `OR` `XOR` `NOT`), lookup
(`VLOOKUP` `HLOOKUP` `INDEX` `MATCH` `CHOOSE` `ROWS` `COLUMNS`), conditional aggregates (`SUMIF(S)`
`COUNTIF(S)` `AVERAGEIF(S)`), text (`CONCAT` `TEXTJOIN` `LEN` `LEFT` `RIGHT` `MID` `TRIM` `UPPER`
`LOWER` `PROPER` `SUBSTITUTE` `REPLACE` `FIND` `SEARCH` `VALUE` `REPT` `EXACT` `CHAR` `CODE`),
information (`IS*` `N` `T` `NA` `ERROR.TYPE`), and date/time (`DATE` `YEAR` `MONTH` `DAY` `HOUR`
`MINUTE` `SECOND` `WEEKDAY` `TIME` `DAYS` `EDATE` `EOMONTH`).

**Not evaluated in 0.8** (documented, never silently wrong — an unknown function is `#NAME?`, an
unsupported reference a typed error value): `ROW`/`COLUMN`, `XLOOKUP`, `DATEVALUE`, `TEXT`, wildcard
`SEARCH` (matched literally), array arithmetic inside an aggregator (`SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)` → a typed
`#VALUE!`, not an element-wise array), 3-D references (`Sheet1:Sheet3!A1` → `#REF!`),
`OFFSET`/`INDIRECT`, R1C1, cross-workbook references, and iterative-calculation mode. Semantics
follow documented Excel; a single-cell reference passed to an aggregate is treated as a literal (so
text/booleans in one referenced cell coerce rather than being ignored — multi-cell ranges are
Excel-exact).

## Tables, data validation & conditional formatting (0.9)

Three structural features that read AND write, each as the same record on both sides — so
read → modify → write carries them across untouched:

- **Tables** (`Worksheet.tables` ↔ `SheetInput.tables`) — a defined table's name, range, columns
  (with totals-row label/function and formulas), header/totals flags, and style banding. On write,
  column names derive from the header row; the numeric id and part number are assigned for you.
- **Data validation** (`Worksheet.dataValidations` ↔ `SheetInput.dataValidations`) — dropdowns and
  input rules: all eight types (`list`/`whole`/`decimal`/`date`/`time`/`textLength`/`custom`/`none`),
  the comparison operator, operand text, prompt/error messages, and `showDropDown` in its intuitive
  sense (`true` = arrow shown; the file's inverted attribute is translated for you).
- **Conditional formatting** (`Worksheet.conditionalFormatting` ↔ `SheetInput.conditionalFormatting`)
  — highlight rules (`cellIs`/`expression`/`top10`/text/… with an inline differential style), color
  scales, data bars, and icon sets. Rule priorities are renumbered densely on write.
- **AutoFilter** (`Worksheet.autoFilter` ↔ `SheetInput.autoFilter`) — the filter-dropdown range,
  `{ ref: 'A1:C10' }`. On write the paired hidden `_xlnm._FilterDatabase` defined name Excel expects
  is created for you; per-column filter *criteria* and sort state are not carried.
- **Protection** (`Worksheet.protection` ↔ `SheetInput.protection`, `Workbook.protection` ↔
  `WorkbookInput.protection`, `CellStyle.protection`) — lock a sheet (`{ sheet: true }`) or the workbook
  structure (`{ lockStructure: true }`), and mark cells `{ locked, hidden }` (cells are locked by default;
  set `locked: false` to leave a cell editable in a protected sheet). Any password hash is carried
  verbatim — openjsxl never computes, verifies, or strips one.

```ts
const bytes = await writeXlsx({
	sheets: [{
		name: 'Inventory',
		rows: [['Item', 'Qty', 'Status'], ['Pears', 8, 'Low']],
		tables: [{ name: 'Stock', ref: 'A1:C2', columns: [], headerRow: true, totalsRow: false }],
		dataValidations: [{ sqref: ['C2'], type: 'list', formula1: '"In stock,Low,Out"', showDropDown: true }],
		conditionalFormatting: [{
			sqref: ['B2'],
			rules: [{ type: 'cellIs', priority: 1, operator: 'lessThan', formulas: ['10'],
				dxf: { fill: { bgColor: { rgb: 'FFFFC7CE' } } } }],
		}],
		autoFilter: { ref: 'A1:C2' },
	}],
});
```

Consistent with the whole library, the tolerant reader normalizes a foreign producer's out-of-spec
table (an odd name, a mismatched column count, a totals row with nowhere to go) into something the
strict writer accepts, so a table file from another tool re-saves instead of aborting.

## Why

JavaScript has no Excel library that is, all at once, maintained, permissively licensed,
published on npm, ESM/TypeScript-first, dependency-free, and fast. SheetJS's public **npm**
release is frozen on a 2022 build that predates its own security fix — current releases ship
only from a vendor CDN, and styled write is a paid tier; ExcelJS is MIT and full-featured but
effectively unmaintained (no release since 2023, hundreds of open issues). openjsxl aims for
that empty square — taking the speed lessons of Python's
[`python-calamine`](https://pypi.org/project/python-calamine/) and growing toward the
capability of [`openpyxl`](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/).

## Performance

"Fast" is measured, not asserted. Against the JS incumbents on an Apple M2 Pro (Node 24), a
**1-million-cell** sheet (median wall-time · peak RSS, each library in an isolated process):

| 1M cells | openjsxl | ExcelJS `4.4.0` | SheetJS `0.18.5` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **read** | **0.72 s · 204 MB** | 1.6 s · 806 MB | 2.2 s · 537 MB |
| **write** | **0.72 s · 396 MB** | 3.2 s · 1.4 GB | 2.5 s · 565 MB |

Writing with `streamXlsx` from a lazy row source holds memory roughly **flat (~95 MB)** no matter
the row count (flat in *rows* — embedded images, when present, stay resident until the stream ends).

**Reads more than `.xlsx`.** The same million cells as `.xlsb`, `.ods`, and `.csv`, each parsed and
materialized cell-by-cell — openjsxl leads every format (e.g. `.xlsb` in **0.20 s** vs SheetJS's
1.66 s; ExcelJS reads neither `.xlsb` nor `.ods`).

**And it stays small** — a clean production install (`npm install --omit=dev`), the library plus every
runtime dependency on disk:

| | openjsxl | ExcelJS `4.4.0` | SheetJS `0.18.5` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| runtime deps | **0 third-party** (1 pkg — its own core) | 96 packages | 8 packages |
| installed | **~0.45 MB** | 34 MB | 14 MB |

The full matrix (10k / 100k / 1M cells, numbers / strings / styled, read + write), the four-format
read lanes, the library-size table, the methodology, and out-of-band **openpyxl** /
**python-calamine** reference numbers are in [`docs/benchmarks.md`](./docs/benchmarks.md) — reproduce
it end-to-end with `pnpm bench`. _(Measured 2026-07-14; every "fast" in these docs traces back here.)_

## Approach

- **Read first, then write.** A fast, correct reader earned trust first; the writer (0.3) is its
  mirror image — every byte it emits reads back through the reader.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Zip inflate/deflate comes from the platform
  (`DecompressionStream` / `CompressionStream`), strings from `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`.
- **Layered & swappable.** `zip → xml → ooxml → reader`, with the hot path behind an
  interface so a native (napi-rs / WASM `calamine`) backend can slot in later.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`openjsxl`](./packages/openjsxl) | Public facade — the package users install |
| [`@openjsxl/core`](./packages/core) | The zero-dependency OOXML engine |
| `@openjsxl/fixtures` | Private test corpus + generator |

## Development

Requires Node ≥ 24 and pnpm.
